# Text Classification with Hugging Face Transformers

This repository contains code for training and evaluating a text classification model using the Hugging Face Transformers library in a Google Colab environment.

## Overview

This code performs the following tasks:

- Loads a dataset from Google Drive or from this repo.
- Preprocesses the text data by cleaning and encoding labels.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Tokenizes the text data using a pre-trained tokenizer.
- Initializes a pre-trained model for sequence classification.
- Trains the model on the training dataset.
- Evaluates the model on both the training and testing datasets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Google Colab environment
- Internet connection

## Usage

1. Open the notebook `Text_Classifier.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook for any necessary inputs, such as the file path and column names.
